- **Redis**: officially the system can work with file cache

## Installation Methods

JT-Trader can be installed in three ways depending on your needs:

### üöÄ Launcher - for users
If you simply want to use JT-Trader for trading and don't plan to develop your own robots, then **Launcher** is the ideal choice. It will automatically install everything needed and configure the system for you.

### üê≥ Docker - for server deployments  
If you want to deploy JT-Trader on your server or in the cloud, then **Docker** is a convenient way. You can easily scale the system and manage multiple instances.

### üì¶ GitHub - for developers
If you plan to develop your own trading robots or make changes to the code, then installing from **GitHub** will give you full control over the source code and customization capabilities.

## 1. Installation via Launcher

**Launcher** is the simplest way to install JT-Trader. It automatically downloads all necessary components, configures the environment, and launches the application. Perfect for those who want to quickly start working with the system.

### Downloading Launcher

Choose the version for your operating system:

| Operating System | Download Link |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Windows** | [JT-Trader-Launcher-Setup.exe](https://jt-launcher.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/releases/latest/JT-Trader-Launcher-Setup.exe) |
| **macOS (Intel)** | [JT-Trader-Launcher.dmg](https://jt-launcher.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/releases/latest/JT-Trader-Launcher.dmg) * |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon)** | [JT-Trader-Launcher-arm64.dmg](https://jt-launcher.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/releases/latest/JT-Trader-Launcher-arm64.dmg) * |

:::important macOS Requirements
After installing the application on macOS, you need to remove the quarantine by running the command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/JT-Trader Launcher.app"
```

This is necessary for the application to work correctly on macOS.

## 2. Installation via Docker

Docker provides an isolated environment for running JT-Trader without the need to install dependencies on the main system. Great for deployment on servers and cloud environments.

### Installing Docker

Download and install the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for your operating system.

### Quick Installation

#### Windows

1. Create a working directory for the application
2. Download the [setup-windows.bat](https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-trader/blob/main/docker/setup-windows.bat) file and place it in the working directory
3. Run `setup-windows.bat`
4. After installation is complete, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8080/`

#### Linux / macOS

1. Create a working directory for the application
2. Download the [setup.sh](https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-trader/blob/main/docker/setup.sh) file and place it in the working directory
3. Open terminal, navigate to the working directory and run:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

4. After installation is complete, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8080/`

---

## 3. Direct Installation from GitHub
üì¶ **GitHub repository:** [jt-lab-com/jt-trader](https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-trader)

For developers and advanced users who want full control over the installation process. This method is necessary if you plan to develop your own trading robots or modify the source code.

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository along with the [jt-lib](https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-lib) submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-trader.git
```

**Alternatively:** If you already have a cloned repository without submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jt-lab-com/jt-trader.git
cd jt-trader
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd jt-trader && yarn
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory, copying the contents of `.env.example`, and specify values for the following environment variables:


### Example .env Configuration

```env
# Basic settings
PORT=8080
SITE_API_HOST=https://jt-lab.com
STANDALONE_APP=1

# Trading engine mode: both, realtime, tester
ENGINE_MODE="both"

# File and directory paths
DATABASE_URL="file:/path/to/your/project/storage.db"
ROLLUP_TS_CONFIG=tsconfig.bundler.json
STRATEGY_FILES_PATH=/path/to/your/project/strategy-source/src
MARKETS_FILE_PATH=markets.json
ARTIFACTS_DIR_PATH=/path/to/your/project/artifacts
HISTORY_BARS_PATH=downloaded-history-bars
LOGS_DIR_PATH=artifacts

# Redis (optional - system can work with file cache)
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Variable Description

| `STANDALONE_APP` | Local operation mode (1 = enabled) | `1` |
| `ENGINE_MODE` | Trading engine mode | `"both"`, `"realtime"`, `"tester"` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Absolute path** to SQLite database file | `"file:/path/to/your/project/storage.db"` |
| `STRATEGY_FILES_PATH` | **Absolute path** to strategy source code | `/path/to/your/project/strategy-source/src` |
| `ROLLUP_TS_CONFIG` | Path to TypeScript configuration | `tsconfig.bundler.json` |

**Example for Windows:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:C:/Users/YourName/jt-trader/storage.db"
STRATEGY_FILES_PATH=C:/Users/YourName/jt-trader/strategy-source/src
ARTIFACTS_DIR_PATH=C:/Users/YourName/jt-trader/artifacts
```

**Example for Linux/macOS:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:/home/username/jt-trader/storage.db"
STRATEGY_FILES_PATH=/home/username/jt-trader/strategy-source/src
ARTIFACTS_DIR_PATH=/home/username/jt-trader/artifacts
```

### Build and Run

# JT-Trader: Open Platform for Algorithmic Trading

Hello, colleagues!

I present to you **JT-Trader** - an open-source system for creating, testing, and launching trading robots on cryptocurrency exchanges. This is a full-featured platform that we developed for algorithmic trading. With its help, you can:
- **Create** trading robots in TypeScript
- **Test** strategies on historical data
- **Monitor** bot operation in real-time
- **Launch** automated trading on multiple exchanges

The system is completely open, with detailed documentation and ready-made strategy examples.

## What We Built Into the Platform

**Unified Development:**
• TypeScript everywhere - one code works everywhere
• Single API for tester and live trading
• Ready-made functions for market work

**Powerful Testing:**
• Backtest on historical data
• Testing on multiple pairs at once
• Automatic search for best parameters
• Realistic conditions (fees, spreads)

**Convenient Management:**
• Web interface - everything through browser
• Full control over bots
• Detailed reports and logs

## We Need Your Help!

We strive to make JT-Trader the most convenient and functional tool for algorithmic trading. But without feedback from the community, this is impossible.

Every your comment, suggestion, or question helps us make the platform better. We carefully read all feedback and actively develop the project based on it.

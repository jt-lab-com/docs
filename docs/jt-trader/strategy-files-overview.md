### Commands:

1. In the **Select strategy** field, choose the desired strategy bundle.
2. Click the **Build Bundle** button to build the package.
3. After the process completes, a message will appear:
   âœ… *"Build completed successfully"*

A script compiled using the **Build Bundle** command can be deployed on any user server without the need to copy the source code to the server.
